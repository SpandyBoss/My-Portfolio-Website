# Intro

**Passwords** are most important thing in our online security and the passwords must be strong so that our info can't get leaked.

So in this post, which is my first one I am going to tell you how to make a **password generator in python .**

# Required Modules

For this python project we will require only two built-in python modules that are :-

- string
- random

## Use of the modules

1. **string** : We will use this module to add different characters to our password so it becomes strong and difficult to crack.

2. **random** : We will be using this module to pick random characters .

# Let's Code

Start by importing the modules

```
import random
import string
```

Now we are going to create our variables which will use string module to store all characters

```
str1 = string.ascii_lowercase #This will store all the lower case alphabets

str2 = string.ascii_uppercase This will store all the upper case alphabets

str3 = string.digits This will store all the digits

str4 = string.punctuation This will store all the punctuation marks which will
make our password more strong

```

Now we will ask user for how much length the password should be and make an empty list which will join our variables in which all characters are stored

```
pwdlen = int(input("Enter password length\n"))
s = []
s.extend(list(str1))
s.extend(list(str2))
s.extend(list(str3))
s.extend(list(str4))
```

Now finally we will generate the password and print it

```
print("Your password is: ")
print("".join(random.sample(s, pwdlen)))
a = input("")
```

You can access this code at my **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SpandyBoss/Password-Generator-in-Python)**
I hope you all liked this post .
