## Introduction

Hello everyone, in this post, as the title suggests I am going to provide links to some of the most useful websites that every developer should know about. 

## 1. [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en)

If you find an interesting color combination or a color that you want to use but don’t exactly know the color name of HEX code, then this website will make it all lot easier. You just have to click a screenshot of the portion containing the color you want and then open up the website and paste the image there. After that you will see a box containing the color palette and you can then copy the code

## 2. [Wordcounter](http://Wordcounter.net)

Let’s say you have a huge paragraph online and you want to write it down on a sheet, but you don’t have an idea how many words does it contain or how many lines/pages will it take. [Wordcounter.net](http://Wordcounter.net) will help you with it. Just copy and paste the text into the textbox and your work is done. There are a lot of details that you can see on the left side of the textbox like: How many  page(s) will the text cover, how many lines will be taken up, the reading level of the text, writing time and much more! All of these options can be enabled from the options button on the top.

## 3. [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)

There are several tools available online for icons and different assets for your websites, but “The Noun Project" has a vast library of high quality icons. It has a database of over 5 million icons! Though it has some premium icons, but no worries you can download them but with a watermark of the creator at the bottom of the icon.

## 4. [Undesign](https://undesign.learn.uno/)

Undesign is not a resource in itself, but a link to various useful resources for creators and dev and everyday users too. It has tools and resources ranging from inspiration to productivity, automation and much much more! It has 50+ categories of resources and tools.

## 5. [CloudConvert](http://cloudconvert.com)

[Cloudconvert.com](http://Cloudconvert.com) is one of my personal favourite tool that I use frequently. Because as a dev and also on daily basis we have to sometimes convert one file type to another. You may say that we can just rename the file by changing the extension, but it doesn’t always work, you might damage that file or moreover its not possible to change extension on phones. CloudConvert has a huge file converter library for every possible extension from .mp4 to .ttf to .ppt and much more. Also it is very simple to convert files using cloudconvert! Here is an example below to convert mp4 to gif

## 6. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)

Imgur is a free platform which you can use to host media files. It is very simple to use website. You just need a free account and that’s it! You can now upload images, videos, gifs on it for free. I personally use it too with ShareX. Whenever I record my screen or capture it, the media file gets uploaded to imgur and I get a shortened link to access it. The gifs in this post are embedded by using it.

## 7. [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) (For devs)

DevDocs is a website where you can find documentation of every programming language, all in one place. It ranges from html to bash to npm! It has detailed documentation.

## 8. [Remove.bg](http://remove.bg)

Sometimes, we need to remove the background of the image in order to use it somewhere. For this purpose you can use [remove.bg](http://remove.bg) it is super simple to use, just upload the image file or url and then it will automatically remove the bg and provide you the edited image. It is very accurate also in removing the background!
