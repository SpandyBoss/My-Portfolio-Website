Hey everyone! Today's post is all about getting the best results from ChatGPT using prompts. Prompts are like instructions that tell ChatGPT what you want it to do.

## The Prompt That Makes More Prompts!

Here's a cool trick: you can use one prompt to get a bunch of other helpful prompts!  This prompt basically asks ChatGPT to come up with different prompts for you, tailored to what you want to achieve. Here's how it works:

Copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT:

```
Give me 5 perfect ChatGPT prompts that really show the potential of ChatGPT.

Focus the prompts around [your topic/goal]

Before you write anything, be sure to ask me any relevant questions regarding the prompt until you're sure that you can provide the optimal prompts
```

Answer any questions ChatGPT asks to make the prompts super customized for you.

ChatGPT will give you 5 different prompts you can try!

## Bonus Tip!

After you get your 5 prompts, you can ask ChatGPT one more question:

```
Out of these prompts, which one will give me the best output?
```

This can help you pick the best prompt to try first, but feel free to experiment with all of them!
