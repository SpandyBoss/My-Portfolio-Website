## Hello World: How I Revamped My Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Hey guys! So, I recently revamped my [portfolio](https://span41n.vercel.app) website and I thought I’d share my experience with you. I used Next.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion to redesign the UI and add some more features to it.

## Getting Started

Before starting, I sketched out some ideas and brainstormed on what features to include. (For example: Blog feature, contact form, etc.) Once I had a clear idea, I began working on the website step by step. 

## Adding Interactive Elements

Next, I used JavaScript to create interactive elements on the website. I added animations and transitions using Framer Motion, which gave the website a more professional and polished look.

## Styling the Website

TailwindCSS allowed me to style the website quickly and efficiently, and I utilized its responsive design features to make sure the website looked great on all devices.

## Testing and Feedback

Throughout the development process, I made sure to test the website continuously to ensure that it was functioning correctly and was user-friendly. I also Requested feedback from friends to get an outside perspective on how to improve the website.
Also I would like if you all give the feedback too for [my website](https://span41n.vercel.app)
